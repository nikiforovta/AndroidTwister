# AndroidTwister

This is a Twister game for Android.
## Desriprtion
The rules of the game are similar to the rules of the original *Twister*. On the playing field there are special sections (4 rows of 6 circles) of different colors, on one of which
 the player puts his finger for a limited time at the direction of the roulette and holds it until the end of the game or a change of position as a result of the next scrolling of the 
roulette.

The game is played by 2 to 10 players, each of whom can put on the field from 1 to 5 fingers of one hand, the turn time is set from 5 to 15 seconds (these game settings are located in 
a separate menu). The winner is the last player remaining in the field.

**A player is eliminated from the game if he**:</br>
- does not put his finger in the specified place during his turn,
- removes his finger not in his turn,
- regardless of the move removes his finger, provided that not all fingers are on the field.
